# Langbuddy - English Web App powered by ChatGPT


## Description
Langbuddy is a web application tailored for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, LangBuddy aims to enrich the English
learning experience and facilitate effective study journal management.

## Features

**Study Plan System**: The user can create study items with tailored schedules.

**Review System with spaced repetition strategy**: When the study items are finished, they can be transformed into review items in a selected spaced repetition pattern to consolidate the learning outcome.

**Chatbots with translation and voice function**: Four chatbots powered by ChatGPT are built with translation, voice recognition and voice synthesis functions. 

**Integration among study systems and chatbots**: The above three systems are integrated seamlessly. The study item can be transferred to review items with a selected pattern. Furthermore, there is another learning area which gives users opportunities to view the study task and review tasks scheduled for today and interact with the Chatbots at the same time. The chat content can also be added to the review systems when needed.
